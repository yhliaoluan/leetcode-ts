Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

<pre>
**Input:** l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
**Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4]
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
**Input:** l1 = [], l2 = []
**Output:** []
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre>
**Input:** l1 = [], l2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
