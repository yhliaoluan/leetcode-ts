1791 Find Center of Star Graph

There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and **exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `u<sub>i</sub>` and `v<sub>i</sub>`. Return the center of the given star graph.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/24/star_graph.png)

<pre>
**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
**Output:** 1
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= u<sub>i,</sub> v<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* `u<sub>i</sub> != v<sub>i</sub>`
* The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.
